- [x]distance function
- [x]read and parse TSP file load onto a map
- plot coordinates onto a graph
- implement brute force algorithm


Brute Force Algorithm:
TODO:
1. pick a random city (from available nodes in map)
    -keep track of starting city which we'll have to return to when we've
    exhausted all cities in map.
2. iterate thru rest of map finding shortest path to next city
    -every time we find the next city, we have to keep track of it already being visited.
3. repeat until all cities are exhausted
4. return to starting city.
5. calculate total travel cost?
